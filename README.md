This repository demonstrates an uncommon Kotlin code error involving the use of regular expressions and exception handling.  The `bug.kt` file contains the flawed code that fails to properly handle the potential exceptions that can occur during the extraction of numbers from the input string. The `bugSolution.kt` file provides a corrected version of the code, demonstrating the importance of proper exception handling and the correct implementation of regular expressions in Kotlin. This example highlights how subtle issues in regex patterns and error handling can cause unexpected behavior.
